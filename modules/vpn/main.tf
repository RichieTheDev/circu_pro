Certainly! Hereâ€™s your Terraform configuration with detailed comments explaining each resource:

# Create an AWS Direct Connect Gateway
# This enables a dedicated network connection between on-premises infrastructure and AWS.
resource "aws_dx_gateway" "dx_gateway" {
  name            = "onprem_to_aws_dx_gateway"  # Name of the Direct Connect Gateway
  amazon_side_asn = "64512"  # ASN (Autonomous System Number) assigned by AWS for BGP routing
}

# Establish a VPN Connection to AWS
# This VPN connection allows secure communication between on-premises infrastructure and AWS.
resource "aws_vpn_connection" "vpn_connection" {
  customer_gateway_id = aws_customer_gateway.customer_gateway.id  # Reference to the on-premises VPN gateway
  type                = "ipsec.1"  # Specifies that this is an IPSec VPN connection
}

# Create an S3 Bucket for Storing Transferred Files
# This bucket will store files that are uploaded from the on-premises system.
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "file_storage" {
  bucket = "onprem-file-storage-bucket"  # Unique name for the S3 bucket
}

Explanation of Key Components

1. Direct Connect Gateway (aws_dx_gateway)

Acts as the connection point between on-prem and AWS.

Uses BGP ASN (Autonomous System Number) for routing traffic.



2. VPN Connection (aws_vpn_connection)

Establishes a secure IPSec tunnel between on-premises and AWS.

The customer_gateway_id refers to an on-prem VPN device (defined separately).



3. S3 Bucket (aws_s3_bucket)

Used for storing files transferred from on-premises to AWS.

Can be secured with encryption and access policies if needed.




This setup ensures secure and reliable file transfer from on-prem infrastructure to AWS S3. Let me know if you need any modifications or enhancements!
